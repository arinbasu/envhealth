    "- Roads can generate air pollution when people drive cars on them\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inversion Layer\n",
    "- Normally, we have warm air below closer to the ground\n",
    "- Cold air resides above the warm layer\n",
    "- The warm layer gradually rises and the cold air subsides\n",
    "- In this situation, the warm air is trapped above the cold air\n",

    "- Children's lung function are immature\n",
    "- They are shorter in height\n",
    "- Therefore exposed to air pollutants in higher concentrations\n",
    "- The younger a child, the worse it gets as till about 8 years of age, children's lungs do not mature enough\n",
